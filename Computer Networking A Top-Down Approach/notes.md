## ch01 Computer Networks and the Internet

1.1 什么是Internet?

1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world. 

传统上计算设备有：PC，工作站，服务器；现在有了很多如智能手机，笔记本等。都统称为`主机（host）`或`终端系统（end systems）`

`communication links`, `packet switch`, `transmission rate`, 

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication
links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links.

packet switches (two most prominent types): routers (used in network core), link-layer switches (used in access networks).

End systems access the Internet through `Internet Service Providers (ISPs)`,
including residential ISPs such as local cable or telephone companies; corporate
ISPs; university ISPs; and ISPs that provide WiFi access in airports, hotels, coffee
shops, and other public places.


The
`Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)` and the `Internet Protocol (IP)` are two of
the most important protocols in the Internet. The IP protocol specifies the format of
the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. The Internet’s
principal protocols are collectively known as `TCP/IP.` 


1.1.2 A Services Description

 as
an infrastructure that provides services to applications. Include electronic mail, Web surfing, social networks, instant messaging, Voiceover-IP (VoIP), video streaming, distributed games, peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, television over the Internet, remote login, and much, much more.  are said to be `distributed applications`

**1.1.3 What is a Protocol?**

**A Human Analogy**

**Network Protocols**

>A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

**1.2 The Network Edge**

`data center`, 

**1.2.2 Access Networks**

access network—the network that physically connects an end
system to the first router (also known as the “edge router”) on a path from the end
system to any other distant end system

**Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH(fiber to the home), Dial-Up, and Satellite**


**Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and WiFi**

 Although there
are many types of LAN technologies, Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access
technology in corporate, university, and home networks. 

**Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE**



**1.2.2 Physical Media**

**Twisted-Pair Copper Wire**

**Coaxial Cable**

`shared medium`, 

**Fiber Optics**

**Terrestrial Radio Channels**

**Satellite Radio Channels**

**1.3 The Network Core**
